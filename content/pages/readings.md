Identify a potential user/consumer of your mini-project. Share your prototype with an individual or group of individuals that most genuinely reflects your intended user. In your design journal, describe the user feedback (preferably in visual form) and how you incorporated it into subsequent iterations of your mini-project.

Playtest your prototype in a setting that more authentically reflects the context for your final project innovation. Compile data from your playtest and create an effective data visualization that summarizes results from participants. Include recommendations for the next design cycle based on participant feedback.

Show how you used data from the additional pilot testing to make improvements to your final project. Use effective visuals.

Invite a partner organization that would potentially use your tool. Craft the presentation as a real pitch to their organization. Ask them to provide you feedback following your presentation.
