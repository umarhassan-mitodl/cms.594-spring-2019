Class 4: Final demonstration of your data-driven work
-----------------------------------------------------

During this session, each team will present the visualization project that they have created to the rest of the class and propose potential applications in an educational setting. We will discuss each prototype in terms of usability, privacy, and its potential to become a real data-driven product in an educational environment. In the end of the class we will introduce the next unit.

### Session activities:

*   Each mini-project will be presented in front of the class with time for Q&A and feedback.
*   Students will write a reflection in their {{% resource_link ace93d2b-fbf7-732b-4baf-d796ac722cc5 "design journals" %}} on what they would do if they had four more weeks to work on mini-project #1.

Class 5: Introduction to practice spaces
----------------------------------------

Practice spaces are learning experiences inspired by games and simulations which allow educators to reflect on important decisions in teaching. In this class, students will learn about the role that practice plays in teacher learning and develop an understanding of how to identify a setting and problem around which to design practice spaces.

For mini-project #2, you will develop a practice space for an educational setting of your choosing. The practice space will need to be designed to help users practice specific teaching skills that an educator would use in an educational setting. The practice space can be designed for any type of educational setting; it does not have to be specifically designed for K-12 teachers. You can also iterate on an existing Teaching Systems Lab (TSL) practice space. You should have a clear of idea of your intended user, setting, and the specific skills that you want the user to practice.

### Session activities:

*   We will begin class by playesting some existing TSL practice spaces. The instructor will provide a brief introduction to the philosophy behind practice spaces and how to identify an appropriate setting and problem for a practice space. Students will then have an opportunity to use work-time to create their own practice spaces.
*   Complete an exit ticket.

Class 6: Designing practice spaces
----------------------------------

Designing a practice involves a number of different design considerations that affect the user’s experience in practice spaces. In this class, we discuss the design considerations when developing a practice space. Students will have an opportunity to get feedback from the instructor and peers about the proposed designs for their mini-project #2 practice space.

### Session activities:

*   Following a lecture and discussion on design considerations in practice spaces, students will playtest and receive feedback on each other’s prototypes from peers and the instructor. Students will have time at the end of class to work on their prototypes.
*   Complete an exit ticket.

Class 7: Demonstrations of practice space mini-projects
-------------------------------------------------------

This class will provide students with opportunities to present their revised practice space and get feedback on their practice spaces from their classmates to inform subsequent design cycles.

### Session activities:

*   Depending on the number of students in the class, we will either playtest the prototypes as a whole class or break out into groups. Students should take notes while people are playesting their prototype so they can make improvements for subsequent iterations.
*   Students will have time at the end of class to work on a {{% resource_link ace93d2b-fbf7-732b-4baf-d796ac722cc5 "design journal" %}} entry from this mini-project about what they would do if they had four more weeks to work on this project.
*   Complete an exit ticket.

No slides for class 7. 

Class 8: Choose a UDL principle and a learning environment to improve
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This class will explore accessibility from a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) perspective. UDL considers how to design up front to consider the variability of students, including students with disabilities. UDL is organized by three principles on the how , what , and why of learning. The UDL guidelines map what we understand about educational neuroscience in terms of how the affect network, the recognition network, and the strategic network relate to learning. The UDL guidelines provide a translational framework that aims to frame what we know from neuroscience into design guidelines for learning. In this session we will look at two example technologies: Book Builder, and the game You Make Me Sick .

### Session activities:

*   Using the UDL guidelines version 2.2: For the mini-project we will self-organize into three groups that focus on the How, What, and Why of learning. Based on the group you select, your group will focus on one of the principles of UDL. You will be provided the UDL guidelines 2.2 which has checkpoints beneath the three principles of UDL. Your group will choose 1-3 checkpoints from the principle you selected (How, What, or Why) and illustrate the influence of the checkpoints(s) on educational technology.
*   Working individually or in small groups, students will compare Book Builder with another technology. Students will select the comparison technology from the {{% resource_link "663489b4-7fc4-43c9-9218-427ccfb8aec8" "curated list of free online books" %}}. Alternatively, students may consider one of the mini-projects from previous sessions in this course.
*   After considering how UDL can improve the comparison technology, we will discuss what we saw in terms of features available in Book Builder and the comparison technology.

Class 9: Playtest
-----------------

We will discuss how current assessment practices may not be ideal in determining the impact of UDL. In the reading for this week, “UDL in the middle school science classroom: Can video games and alternative text heighten engagement and learning for students with learning disabilities?”, there is a brief discussion about students’ perceptions of UDL and assessment. We will use those student reflections to discuss how we might assess the impact of the proposed changes.

### Session activities:

*   Short lecture followed by opportunity to give feedback on each other’s prototypes. Students will work on their mini-project #3 prototypes in the remaining class time.
*   Complete an exit ticket.

Class 10: **Refine and final demo**
-----------------------------------

This class will provide students with opportunities to get feedback on their UDL prototypes from their classmates.

### Session activities:

*   Depending on the number of students in the class, we will either playtest the prototypes as a whole class or break out into groups.
*   Students should take notes while people are playesting their prototype so they can make improvements on future projects.
*   Students will complete a short {{% resource_link ace93d2b-fbf7-732b-4baf-d796ac722cc5 "design journal" %}} writing about what they would do if they worked on this for four more weeks for the final project.
*   The last 30-60 minutes of class will include a preview of the structure for the final project unit.
*   Complete an exit ticket.

Class 11: Problem finding—empathy/stakeholder interviews
--------------------------------------------------------

Working individually or in pairs as deemed appropriate, students will identify an extension of their mini-project that will become their final project. Students will identify a problem of practice to which their technology provides a potential solution and context for their innovation. Students will prepare for conducting an interview with a potential user/stakeholder.

### Session activities:

*   Part 1: Identifying a problem of practice: In your {{% resource_link ace93d2b-fbf7-732b-4baf-d796ac722cc5 "design journal" %}}, working in your final project pairs (or individually), use the template to create four slides as follows:
    1.  **Problem of practice:** state the educational problem of practice where your innovation provides a potential solution. You may include links to supporting evidence of the importance of this problem of practice (e.g. articles, blogs, media), images, and/or other supporting data;
    2.  **Existing solution:** how have others addressed this problem?
    3.  **Proposed solution:** describe how the proposed extension to your select mini-project can help with the problem of practice in a way that addresses limitations of or adds value to existing solutions. You may include sketches or images that can help others visualize your idea;
    4.  **Proposed learning objective:** what specific objective should your proposed solution accomplish for the user?
    5.  **Potential user:** brainstorm what a suitable context would be for testing your innovation. Who would be the end user? You may suggest specific partners or contexts if it helps conceptualize your innovation;
    6.  J**ustification for use of technology:** Why is your medium the optimal one? Note that if you choose to elaborate on a mini-project for your final project, your final project must clearly reflect a substantial extension of the mini-project work.
*   Part 2: Drafting empathy interview questions: As a group, we will discuss best practices in stakeholder empathy interviews. Time permitting, students will begin to draft questions for a potential stakeholder/user of their proposed innovation and complete their protocols outside of class.
*   Part 3: Final project overview. The instructor will provide an overview of the elements of the final presentation which include: (1) project prototype, (2) final presentation, and (3) a written product.
*   Complete an exit ticket.

Class 14: Final project presentations
-------------------------------------

Students will present their final projects to an audience comprised of Teaching Systems Lab staff, student guests (including potential partners and users), classmates, course instructors, and associated MIT faculty. Treat this as "real world" presentation to stakeholders (either internal to your future workplace or external such as clients or partners) where you might (depending on the workplace) be expected to dress up for a presentation and would certainly be expected to have rehearsed and feel comfortable with the content of the presentation. Invite at least two guests to your presentation. Potential users of your innovation are encouraged. Please ensure guests RSVP to the invitation (forthcoming) so that we can ensure proper space.

### Session activities:

*   Students will formally present their final presentations individually or in pairs. Each team will have 15 minutes to present and 5 minutes for discussion with the audience. Students will use the slide deck template created at the end of the previous class to structure their presentations.

No slides for Class 14.
